ðŸ”¹Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a Netflix dataset to uncover insights about movies and TV shows available on the platform.
Using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, this analysis explores data patterns, handles missing values, and visualizes important trends such as the release year, content type, and director details.

ðŸ”¹Objectives

1. Remove duplicate records (if any) from the dataset.

2. Identify and visualize missing/null values using a heatmap.

3. Find the Show ID and Director of House of Cards.

4.Determine which year had the highest number of releases (Movies & TV Shows) using a bar graph.

ðŸ”¹Tools & Technologies

1. Python 3

2. Pandas â€” for data manipulation and analysis

3. Matplotlib & Seaborn â€” for data visualization

4. Jupyter Notebook â€” for analysis and reporting

ðŸ”¹Key Visualizations

Heatmap showing missing values

Bar chart showing most active release years

Count plots showing types of shows/movies

ðŸ”¹Dataset

The dataset used is named Netflix Dataset.csv, which contains details like:

Title
Director
Cast
Country
Release Year
Type (Movie/TV Show)
