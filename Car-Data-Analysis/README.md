ðŸ”¹Project Overview

This project focuses on performing data cleaning and filtering operations on a car dataset using Python and Pandas.
The goal is to identify missing values, handle them properly, analyze car makes, and extract insights by filtering data based on regions like Asia and Europe.

Objectives

Find all null values in the dataset and replace them with the mean of their respective columns.

Check all the unique car makes (brands) present in the dataset and count their occurrences.

Filter and display all the records where the region is Asia or Europe.

Remove unwanted or irrelevant records from the dataset.

ðŸ”¹Tools & Libraries Used

Python 3

Pandas â†’ Data cleaning, manipulation, and filtering

Jupyter Notebook

ðŸ”¹Dataset

The dataset used is named Project+2+-+Cars+Dataset.csv and contains details like:

Car Make (Brand)
Model
Region
Engine Size / Power
Price
Other car specifications

ðŸ”¹How to Run

Open the Jupyter Notebook file Car_Data_Analysis.ipynb and run all the cells sequentially to reproduce the cleaning and filtering process.

ðŸ”¹Key Insights

Missing values handled using column means.

Identified most common car brands in the dataset.

Extracted and analyzed car data for Asia and Europe regions.

ðŸ”¹Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to clean, filter, and interpret raw automotive data effectively using Pandas.
It is a great example of how to handle real-world datasets and prepare them for deeper analysis or visualization.
